# [Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct: State-of-the-art vision-language model capable of understanding images and generating text responses](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct)

Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct is a multimodal vision-language model with 7 billion parameters that can process both images and text, enabling visual question answering, image description, and other vision-language tasks.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct found [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
qai-hub-models numerics Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --runtime geniex_qairt --precision w4a16
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.

## Deploying Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct on-device

Follow the [GenieX quickstart](https://geniex.aihub.qualcomm.com/en/get-started/quickstart) to install GenieX and deploy the model on a target device.

See the [LLM-on-Genie](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial to run with the Genie runtime. Note: Genie support will be deprecated soon.


## Export

### Setup
#### 1. Install the package
Install the package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen2-5-vl-7b-instruct]"
```
For qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct, some additional functionality can be faster or is available
only with a GPU on the host machine.

- 🟢 Exporting the model for on-device deployment (GPU not required)
- 🟡 Running the demo (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🟡 Running evaluation (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🔴 Quantizing the model (GPU required)

If you are quantizing your own variant of qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct, a dedicated CUDA enabled
GPU (40 GB VRAM for 3B models to 80 GB VRAM for 8B models) is recommended. A GPU
can also increase the speed of evaluation and demo of your quantized model
significantly but it not strictly required.

Install the GPU package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen2-5-vl-7b-instruct]"
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2 https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases/download/2.26.0/aimet_onnx-2.26.0+cu121-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

#### 2. Configure Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench
Sign-in to [Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/) with your
Qualcomm® ID. Once signed in navigate to `Account -> Settings -> API Token`.

With this API token, you can configure your client to run models on the cloud
hosted devices.
```bash
qai-hub configure --api_token API_TOKEN
```
Navigate to [docs](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/) for more information.

### Verify with CLI Demo
Run the following simple CLI demo to verify the model is working end to end:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

### Export the model artifact
To run the model on Qualcomm® devices, you must export the model for use with an edge runtime such as
TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Engine Direct.
Export the pre-quantized model (published on AI Hub) for on-device deployment:
```bash
qai-hub-models export qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct --checkpoint DEFAULT_W4A16 --target-runtime geniex_qairt --device "Samsung Galaxy S25 (Family)"
```
`--checkpoint` also accepts `DEFAULT` (the model's default precision).

Optionally, quantize your own variant first and export the resulting checkpoint:
```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct.quantize --precision w4a16 --output-dir ./quantized_checkpoint
qai-hub-models export qwen2_5_vl_7b_instruct --checkpoint ./quantized_checkpoint --target-runtime geniex_qairt --device "Samsung Galaxy S25 (Family)"
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
